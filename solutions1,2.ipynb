#1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?

Independent variable: congruent or incongruent condition.
Dependent variable: Time taken to complete test.

#2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.


Null Hypothesis, H0 - No change in time between two reading tasks (congruent or incongruent)
Alternate Hypothesis, H1 - incongruent task take more time than congruent.
H0: μi ≤ μc (μi - population mean of incongruent values, μc - population mean of congruent values)

H1: μi > μc (μi - population mean of incongruent values, μc - population mean of congruent values)

statistical test dependent t-test (two tailed)

    We need to compare the means of two related groups to determine the statistically significant difference between two means.
    We are assuming distributions are nearly normal and we are comparing 2 dependent samples of data
    our sample size less than 30 and we don't know the population standard deviations
